This webpage will fulfill the purpose of being used as a personal portfolio, where I plan to showcase some of the projects I've worked on, as well as share my interests, including music I enjoy. I might also consider adding a blog, which could be on a separate website. <br>
(Still not finished, by the way.)


## TODO
- Add the last section of the page
- Responsive design that works with mobile devices
- Integration with spotify API so I can load my playlist on a nice way
